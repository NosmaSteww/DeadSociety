Found a problem? Use the issues tab above to raise an issue. Please include all the information requested in the issue template, unless you're certain it's not relevant. Otherwise, contact me on discord.

## Information

• Placeholders - ([PlaceholderAPI](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI/wiki/Placeholders#plugin))

  [+] Before getting started:

  > Perform `/papi list` and see if it contains `deadsociety` on the placeholder hooks registered.
 
  > Then, /papi ecloud download Player.
  
  > Select a placeholder from below and test it by performing `/papi bcparse <Player> <placeholder>`

 Gives you various placeholders for the player, that triggers the action and also returns information about the specified plugin.
 
 ```
  • %deadsociety_gender%
  • %deadsociety_player_kills% 
  • %deadsociety_walker_kills% 
  • %deadsociety_player_deaths% 
  • %deadsociety_kd_ratio%
  • %deadsociety_player_top_place%
```

Keep in mind, if a specific placeholder is not working, this is because you're using an older version.
